# Bio-inspired Sustainable Energy Management
An agent-based simulation model for sustainable energy systems with electric vehicles in Netlogo

This model explores the stability of a sustainable electric vehicle transport system. One can imagine a transport system where electric vehicles have to performs jobs (e.g., transport of cargo). Whenever a job is performed, the battery of the vehicle is drained a bit. Vehicles need to go to the charging every once in a while to recharge their batteries. The energy used for charging is either produced locally – by solar panels and wind turbines – or supplied by the grid. We wish to balance the transport in such a way that the jobs are performed in a timely manner whilst simultaneously trying to use as much as locally produced energy as possible.
